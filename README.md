Hi! I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Davis. I have both technical software internship and research experience, and am interested in research involving human-based data as well as research that allows machines to saliently and semantically process their environments, such as via multimodal input. Broadly, I am interested in machine learning for medicine, language and computer vision (and, by extension, psychology/neuroscience), and hardware-adjacent applications like robotics.
